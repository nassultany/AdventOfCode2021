# Advent of Code 2021
Here are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).
Better late than never right?

I'm currently doing them in C, although I may expand that to include other languages 
I want to practice.

To test them out, just head to the C/ directory for any day, and do `make test` to 
run on the sample input, or `make run` to run on my input. Change the `#define PROBLEM x`
to x=1 or x=2 depending on which problem you want to solve (in main.c).
